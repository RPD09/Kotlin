Welcome to my **Kotlin** repository! This is where I'll be uploading and organizing all the exercises and projects from my university course. The repository will be updated weekly with fresh content as I advance through the course.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **Exercises/**: Weekly exercises categorized by modules.
- **Projects/**: Mini-projects to showcase concepts in practice.

## 🗓️ Current Progress
- **Week 1**: Basics of Kotlin, working with variables and functions
- **Week 2**: Object-Oriented Programming in Kotlin, classes, and loops.
- More coming soon! 🚀

## 🛠️ Projects
- **[Vehicle Operations System](https://github.com/RPD09/Kotlin/tree/main/Projects/Vehicle)**: A simple system to manage different types of vehicles, demonstrating object-oriented principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and interface implementation in Kotlin. The project includes classes for `Car` and `Motorcycle`, both inheriting from a base `Vehicle` class, and showcases how each vehicle type behaves differently while sharing common functionality.
